Newton's Laws of RogueLike

Entry for the GMC Jam 7 - Themed Newton's Laws of Movement

The entry is a simple Roguelike where the enemies are inspired on Newton's Laws of Movement, but, BUT! 
They all look the same in the Dungeon... Good Luck!

How to Play

* Arrows:Move Your Character
* E: Attack
* Space: Restart Level

## Enemies

**The Log:** The log will remain sleeping unless acted upon a force :)

**The Light Log:** This log runs faaaaaaaaaaaaast through the dungeon, just when you are defenseless it hits you! And then he runs, fast.

**The Heavy Log:** This logs run sloooooooooooooooooow through the dungeon, and when you are EXPECTING it hits you! Should be easy to avoid.

**The BOMB Log:** The BOMB Log will punish you for hitting it, with the same force, but on opposite direction :)

I rewatched some classes of his Action RPG Course for this entry, also, I watched his Random Dungeon
 Generation video for GameMaker Studio to reach this results.
I used sounds and effects from his course (I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS ALLOWED, PLEASE MSG ME IF IT ISN'T).

Most of the art is from this link, main character, log enemy, the dungeon tileset was also inspired by this set.
