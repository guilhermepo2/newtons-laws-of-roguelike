# Newton's Laws of RogueLike

Entry for the GMC Jam 7 - Themed Newton's Laws of Movement

The entry is a simple Roguelike where the enemies are inspired on Newton's Laws of Movement, but, BUT! They all look the same in the Dungeon... Good Luck!

## Enemies

**The Log:** The log will remain sleeping unless acted upon a force :)

**The BOMB Log:** The BOMB Log will punish you for hitting it, with the same force, but on opposite direction :)
